# Brian Kosiadi's Portfolio
Data Science Portfolio that displays samples of various works, from exploratory data analysis to predictive modeling and machine learning.

# [Avocado Sales: Experimental Design/Business Project](https://github.com/briankosiadi/Avocado-Sales)
* Processed and cleaned data on avocado prices and volume sales from Hass Avocado Board
* Analyzed trend of sales based on variables such as season and location

# [MLB Pitch Analysis: Pitch Type Classifier](https://github.com/briankosiadi/MLB-Pitches/blob/master/MLB%20Pitches.ipynb)
* Trained a binary classifier to predict whether a pitcher would throw a fastball or offspeed pitch with 60~70% accuracy
* Prediction was based on variables such as pitch count, game score, runners on base, and left/right handed pitcher/batter
* Tested several types of classifiers such as KNN, SVC, GBC in order to find optimal results

# [NBA Player Analysis: Unsupervised Clustering](https://github.com/briankosiadi/Basketball-Player-Clustering/blob/master/Basketball%20Stats.ipynb)
* Compared NBA players of 1990's and modern era to explore evolution of basketball position and roles
* Included visualization techniques such as PCA, UMAP, and correlation heatmaps
* Challenged the traditional notion of standard five positions in basketball by comparing how clustering models grouped types of players

# [Lung Cancer Detection: Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/briankosiadi/Lung-Cancer-Detection)
* Sorted through hundreds of images of chest radiographs depicting positive/negative diagnosis of lung nodules/masses to train model with
* Utilized AutoKeras, an emerging AutoML system that tuned its own parameters over multiple runs to optimize predictions and results
* Built own custom model based off AutoKeras' tuned hyperparameters to also explore effects and impacts of hyperparameters
